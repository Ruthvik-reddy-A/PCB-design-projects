# Breadboard Power Supply Module

This repository documents a simple yet essential module for electronics prototyping: the Breadboard Power Supply. It provides a regulated voltage output (3.3V and/or 5V) directly to your breadboard, making it ideal for microcontroller projects, sensor interfacing, and other DIY circuits.

## ⚙️ Features.
* Input voltage: 6V–12V DC via barrel jack or 5V USB
* Output voltage: Selectable 3.3V / 5V via jumper or switch
* Current capacity: Up to 500mA–1A (depends on regulator used)
* On/Off power switch
* Fits standard breadboard power rails
* Power indicator LED

## 🧩 Components Used
| Component         | Description                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Voltage Regulator | AMS1117 / LM317 / 7805                 |
| Capacitors        | For filtering and stability            |
| Barrel Jack / USB | For external power input               |
| Slide Switch      | To turn power on/off                   |
| Jumper Pins       | Voltage selector (3.3V / 5V)           |
| Header Pins       | To connect with breadboard power rails |

## 🔌 How It Works
1. Supply DC power (6–12V) via the barrel jack or connect 5V via USB.
2. The onboard voltage regulator converts this input to a stable 5V or 3.3V.
3. The output is routed to the breadboard power rails via header pins.
4. Use jumper caps to select the voltage output (if applicable).

## ⚠️ Notes
* Always check input voltage range to prevent regulator damage.
* Verify polarity before connecting to your breadboard.
* Do not exceed the current capacity of the regulator.
